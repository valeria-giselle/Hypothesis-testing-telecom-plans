# 📊 Hypothesis Testing: Telecom Plan Comparison

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes user behavior and revenue patterns for different telecom plans
offered by Megaline. The goal is to evaluate whether there are statistically
significant differences in usage metrics (calls, internet, messaging) and revenue
between plans using hypothesis testing.

This analysis helps support data-driven decisions on pricing, product strategy,
and customer segmentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare key usage metrics across different telecom plans
- Evaluate whether the average revenue differs between plans
- Identify if usage and revenue patterns vary significantly by plan
- Use statistical hypothesis testing to provide evidence for decision-making

## 📁 Data
The analysis relies on multiple datasets provided by Megaline that include:
- User information
- Call records
- Messaging activity
- Internet usage
- Plan details and pricing

These datasets are used to compute user-level metrics and aggregate revenue.

## 📈 Key Findings
- There are clear differences in user behavior and revenue between different
  telecom plans.
- Usage metrics (such as call duration, internet consumption) vary by plan.
- Revenue averages differ across plans, with some plans showing more stable
  revenue distributions.
- Hypothesis testing supports statistically significant differences,
  providing a basis for informed strategic decisions.

## 🧠 Conclusion
The hypothesis testing confirms that plan type has a significant impact on
usage and revenue patterns. These findings enable the business to:

- Optimize pricing strategies based on plan performance  
- Tailor product offerings to customer usage profiles  
- Refine customer segmentation and marketing strategies

By integrating statistical insights with business goals, this project
demonstrates the value of data-driven decision-making in product strategy.
